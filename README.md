# DeepOpenSfM

## Intro
<p>
DeepOpenSfM is additional python interface for <a href="https://github.com/mapillary/OpenSfM">OpenSfM</a>. Because the quality of 3D 
model reconstructed by OpenSfM always depends on the quality of image matching, but traditional key-point-based matching methods usually 
get a lot of wrong correspondence. So we want to use deep learning to solve this tricky problem by making 
<a href="https://github.com/mapillary/OpenSfM">OpenSfM</a> support Deep-Learning-based matching method.
For now we have already support <a href="http://lear.inrialpes.fr/src/deepmatching/">DeepMatching</a>, and we will continue to support 
more Deep-Learning-based matching method. Because the document is not completed yet, if you have any advise or question, just let us know!
