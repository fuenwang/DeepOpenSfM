# DeepOpenSfM

## Intro
DeepOpenSfM is additional python interface for <a href="https://github.com/mapillary/OpenSfM">OpenSfM</a>. Because the quality of 3D 
reconstruction by OpenSfMtraditional key-point-based matching method like HOG, SURF, SIFT  
As a result, our goal is to make <a href="https://github.com/mapillary/OpenSfM">OpenSfM</a> support Deep-Learning-based matching method.
For now we have already support <a href="http://lear.inrialpes.fr/src/deepmatching/">DeepMatching</a>, and we will continue to support 
more Deep-Learning-based matching method.
